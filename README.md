# MonteCarloMethods
Monte Carlo methods are computer simulations involving random numbers. They can be used to simulate the outcome of certain experiments, to generate random variables belonging to unusual distributions or to estimate different values (like lengths or areas).  
In particular, the Monte Carlo method can be used as a method for numerical integration.  
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks attesting my personal experiments with Monte Carlo Simulations.
